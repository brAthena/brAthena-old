<dead>That's the thing that is suitable for you!</dead>
<dead>What? Did you attack it with your current condition? No wonder you end up lying here...</dead>
<dead>Well, you have to die a few times in day. That's the routine.</dead>
<dead>Ok, do you think it's cool to lie there forever? Get up!</dead>
<stand>Why are you standing there? No wonder they think that you're stupid!</stand>
<stand>Get real! Move around! Don't just stand there!</stand>
